Hola, welcome to the app.

This app is quite simple, really, it just allows users to create jobs.
Each job has one or more files associated with it that are used by a 
computational server for processing. 

There is a rake task that should be run by cron periodically to update
the jobs from new to pending or complete based on the filesystem.  All 
files start off as new, but then the job will update them periodically.
This could change to a background watcher, but cron is good enough for
now.

Emails are sent off when jobs are created and then when they are 
complete.  At that point, a link is exposed to allow the user to 
download the complete files.

Simple!

The app is fully unit-tested (with a reasonable amount of controller 
testing), and there are cucumber features, but they aren't tested, I
had issues with that.  They were really brittle too.  No me gusta. But
the cucumber tests were great for communication with the client.  The 
spec tests are the best way to get to know the app functionality.
