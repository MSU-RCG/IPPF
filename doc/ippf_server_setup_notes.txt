Notes when setting up the IPPF VM

Users
 - Remove 'jaderobbins' user
 - Add 'ippf' user

Packages
 - install: curl git-core libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libsqlite3-dev
 
RVM and Ruby
 - become root with: sudo -i
 - bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)
 - NOTE: it added the ippf user to the rvm group automatically, and *I don't know why* though that is what I would have done next!
     Creating RVM system user group 'rvm'
     Ensuring 'ippf' is in group 'rvm'
     Adding user 'ippf' to the RVM group 'rvm'
 - become ippf user with: su ippf
 - echo "[[ -s \"/usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm\" ]] && source \"/usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm\"" >> ~/.bashrc 
 - add following to ~ippf/.gemrc
     ---
     :sources:
     - http://gems.rubyforge.org
     - http://gems.github.com
     gem: --no-ri --no-rdoc
 - NOTE: the system gems for chef are just hanging out there waiting to get clobbered. I didn't think of this, so I think that the app should be using a gemset (@ippf).  However this means that the passenger needs to be compiled in the app gemset.
 
Directory
 - mkdir ~ippf/rails ~ippf/rails-dev

 
Passenger & Nginx
 - become root with `sudo -i`
 - use the gemset that the app is using: rvm use 1.8.7-p302@ippf
 - gem install passenger
 - apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
 - passenger-install-nginx-module
   - click '1' (Yes: Download and compile Nginx for me)
   - click '<enter>' to install nginx to /opt
 - Edit /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf:
     - Add 'server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;' in the http conf section
     - Add the server definitions in the http conf section:
         server {
              listen 80;
              server_name ippf.rcg.montana.edu;
              root /home/ippf/rails/current/public;
              passenger_enabled on;
          }
  
          server {
              listen 8080;
              server_name ippf.rcg.montana.edu;
              root /home/ippf/rails-dev/current/public;
              passenger_enabled on;
          }
     - Make sure it is using the right gemset:
        passenger_root /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p302@ippf/gems/passenger-3.0.7;
        passenger_ruby /usr/local/rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.8.7-p302@ippf/ruby;
 - cd && git clone git://github.com/jnstq/rails-nginx-passenger-ubuntu.git
 - cp rails-nginx-passenger-ubuntu/nginx/nginx /etc/init.d/nginx
 
 
User will need to do the following (app specific)
 - install the ruby they want
   - rvm install 1.8.7
